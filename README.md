# Welcome to the Party!

👋 Hi, I’m Pulkit.

## About Me
- 👀 I’m interested in creating revolutionary technologies and pushing the boundaries of human capability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make an arc reactor in a cave with a box of scraps! (metaphor in intended)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML/AI-driven projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop a message here on GitHub.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/let’s get to work.

Remember, the only thing more important than a cool GitHub profile is how you use your code to change the world.

Stay genius, stay awesome,

Pulkit
