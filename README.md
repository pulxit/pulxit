```python
class Pulkit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack        = ["Python", "TypeScript"]
        self.focus        = ["AI/ML", "System Design"]
        self.heroes       = ["SR-71 Blackbird", "Lewis Hamilton", "RDJ"]
        self.comfort_film = "Interstellar (yes, every rewatch hits different)"
        self.spirit_jet   = "Su-30 — twin-engine, unreasonably agile, slightly unhinged"

    def approach(self):
        # Like Cooper in the Tesseract — figure it out as you go
        return "ship it, learn from it, don't overthink it"
```
